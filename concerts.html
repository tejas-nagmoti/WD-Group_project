        <h2>BoyWithUke</h2>
        <img src="images/Concerts/boywithuke.jpeg" alt="BoyWithUke Concert">
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> What do we know about BoyWithUke? If you quickly scan TikTok, you can figure out he is a musical artist who writes and produces all of his own music, creating songs in his dorm room on GarageBand while hiding his face from the public with his now signature glowing mask. Take a deeper look, and you’ll see he frequently posts “minute-long songs,” many times written in response to requests from fans. His biggest hit to date was written after a fan commented “make a song about toxic friends plzzzx,” and the response was the song “Toxic.” The song describes how it feels when you realize all your friends are terrible people (people you’d probably be better off without), but the thought of being alone makes you feel even worse. The song exploded online, as it vaulted to #1 at Alternative Radio and reached over 1.5 billion global streams to date. Not to mention, his performance of “Toxic” has emerged as the platform’s highest-viewed Genius video to date with over 100 million views and counting. Last year, he embarked on his sold-out international headline tour and released his debut album Serotonin Dreams that features collaborations with blackbear, mxmtoon, Powfu, and more. The project is the follow-up to previous full-length projects Melatonin Dreams, Fever Dreams, Trouvaille EP, and Faded EP (featuring numerous songs created from his TikTok “minute-long songs” project). BoyWithUke kicked off 2023 with his latest single “Rockstar” taken from his recent release—Antisocial EP.<br>

        <h2>$UICIDEBOY$</h2>
        <img src="images/Concerts/Suicideboy.jpg" alt="$UICIDEBOY$ Concert">
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> $uicideboy$ dig light out of the deepest corners of darkness, addiction, hopelessness, and pain. The New Orleans-bred duo of cousins—Scott Arcenaux, Jr. a.k.a. $crim and Aristos Petrou a.k.a. Ruby da Cherry—translate a fight against demons (seen and unseen) into a clever, caustic, and corrosively catchy apocalyptic vision of hip-hop pierced with punk intensity and laced with Southern flows. The world first met $uicideboy$ in 2014. After releasing dozens of projects and playing hundreds of sold-out shows, they’ve generated billions of streams and earned multiple RIAA certifications, including the platinum “…And To Those I Love, Thanks For Sticking Around” and gold “Carrollton,” “2nd Hand,” “Runnin’ Thru The 7th With My Woadies,” “Paris,” and “Kill Yourself (Part III).” Beyond their critical-acclaim from Billboard, XXL, Alternative Press, Pigeons and Planes, Hypebeast, Revolver, and more, they built their label G*59 Records into a bastion of independent talent and home to Night Lovell, Shakewell, Germ, Ramirez, and others. In 2022, the punk-rap duo landed in the Top 30 most-streamed artists across all genres and have climbed to the 92nd position of most-streamed artists of all-time with over 15 billion career streams. Their latest official full-length LP Sing Me A Lullaby, My Sweet Temptation marked their 3rd consecutive Top 10 album debut on the Billboard Top 200. The album led to sold-out arena and amphitheater tours in the US and Europe followed by a top-billed performance spot at Coachella music festival in 2023.<br>
