        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Is she insane? Or just pretending? This psychological drama follows trailblazing reporter Nellie Bly through her internment at Blackwell's Asylum, exposing, as Bly did, notions of madness and societal biases against women. This world premiere from composer Rene Orth and librettist Hannah Moscovitch stars Kiera Duffy (Breaking the Waves) as Nellie, mezzo Raehann Bryce-Davis in her company debut as Lizzie, and baritone Will Liverman as Dr. Blackwell. Daniela Candillari makes her company debut at the podium, and Joanna Settle (Sky on Swings) directs. Designer Andrew Lieberman's set evokes the dark labyrinth of the asylum and Nellie's journey within its walls.</p>

    <!-- Event 4: Unholy Wars -->
    <div>
        <h2>Unholy Wars</h2>
        <img src="images/Opera/unholy.jpg" alt="Unholy Wars Opera">
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Unholy Wars closes the dusty history book and reframes the Crusades from a Middle Eastern perspective to reveal a new story of belonging and resilience. Conceived and created by Lebanese American tenor Karim Sulayman, music by Handel and Monteverdi is interwoven with that of composer Mary Kouyoumdjian to explore and reclaim representations of his identity. Reexamining Baroque interpretations of the Crusades and depictions of the Middle East, Sulayman asks "Can we lean into the discomfort of our collective history while forging a new path forward?" This boundary-breaking piece premiered at Spoleto Festival USA, where critics called it "emotional" and "powerful." The intimate staging directed by Kevin Newbury, with visual narrative by Kevork Mourad, explores the tensions of history, representation, identity, and survival through music and dance.</p>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> September 23, 2023 – October 1, 2023<br>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Curtis Opera Theatre’s 2023–24 season concludes with Janáček’s masterpiece, The Cunning Little Vixen, one of the most powerful operatic works of the 20th century.

Captured by a Forester, the mischievous young fox cub grows up to become a strong, independent vixen, escaping into the wild, where she encounters a forest full of possibilities. Janáček’s adaptation of the beloved Czech novella features a lushly orchestrated, folk-infused score bursting with boundless energy and an imaginative array of dazzling colors. The Cunning Little Vixen is sung in Czech with English supertitles.</p>
