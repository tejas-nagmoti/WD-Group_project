        <h2>10 Days in a Madhouse</h2>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Is she insane? Or just pretending? This psychological drama follows trailblazing reporter Nellie Bly through her internment at Blackwell's Asylum, exposing, as Bly did, notions of madness and societal biases against women. This world premiere from composer Rene Orth and librettist Hannah Moscovitch stars Kiera Duffy (Breaking the Waves) as Nellie, mezzo Raehann Bryce-Davis in her company debut as Lizzie, and baritone Will Liverman as Dr. Blackwell. Daniela Candillari makes her company debut at the podium, and Joanna Settle (Sky on Swings) directs. Designer Andrew Lieberman's set evokes the dark labyrinth of the asylum and Nellie's journey within its walls.</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> A powerhouse cast and some of Verdi's most sumptuous music fuel this sweeping story that mixes political turmoil with poignant family drama. Baritone Quinn Kelsey stars as Simon Boccanegra, a leader coming into great power who must balance duty to his nation with his duties as a father after his long-lost daughter Amelia (soprano Ana María Martínez) reenters his life. Surrounded by poisonous rivals, can he be the man those who love him need him to be and survive the plots of those who hate him?</p>
