                    Campus!

                    With her GRAMMY Award-winning Verve Records debut, Linger Awhile, 23-year-old Bronx native Samara
                    Joy
                    makes her
                    case to join the likes of Sarah, Ella, and Billie as the next mononymous jazz singing sensation
                    recorded
                    by the
                    venerable label.</p>
                <p class="colored-text">Her voice, rich and velevty yet precociously refined, has already earned her
                    fans like Anita Baker and
                    Regina
                    King, appearances on the TODAY Show, The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, The Late Show with Stephen
                    Colbert, CBS

                    on
                    TikTok - cementing her status as perhaps the first Gen Z singing star.</p>
                <p class="colored-text">On Linger Awhile, Samara introduces that massive audience to a slew of classic
                    standards several times

                    she is through her timeless, irresistable sound. The New York Times praised the "silky-voiced rising
                    star" for
                    "helping jazz take a youthful turn" while NPR All Things Considered named her a "classic jazz singer
                    from a new
                    generation. In February 2023, Samara Joy took home two GRAMMY - Best Jazz Vocal Album and the
                    auspicious
                    Best

                <p class="colored-text">Revered as one of the greatest jazz drummers of all time, Max Roach was among
                    the first to use music to
                    address
                    the racial, political, and social issues of his time. The Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra (JLCO)
                    celebrates the
                    centennial of this pioneering legend, master musician and innovative bandleader who spanned a
                    diverse
                    range of
                    styles that influenced generations to follow.</p>
                <p class="colored-text">In 1961, after having been an influential member of the Charlie Parker-Dizzy
                    Gillespie Quintet,

                    and performing alongside Miles Davis’ seminal “Birth of the Cool” album, and a founder of the

                    Abbey
                    Lincoln.
                    At the time, he told DownBeat Magazine that he would “never again play anything” that did not “have
                    social
                    significance.”</p>

                <p class="colored-text">About the Artist</p>
                <p class="colored-text">Multifaceted American jazz pianist and composer Emmet Cohen has emerged as one
                    of
                    his generation's
                    pivotal
                    figures in music and the related arts. A recognized prodigy, Cohen began Suzuki method piano
                    instruction
                    at age
                    three, and his playing quickly became a mature melding of musicality, technique, and concept.
                    DownBeat
                    observed
                    that his "nimble touch, measured stride and warm harmonic vocabulary indicate he's above any
                    convoluted
                    technical showmanship." In the same spirit, Cohen himself has noted that playing jazz is "about
                    communicating
                    the deepest levels of humanity and individuality; it's essentially about connections, both among
                    musicians and
                    audiences." He leads his namesake ensemble, the Emmet Cohen Trio; is a vibrant solo performer, and
                    is in
                    constant demand as a sideman. Posessing a fluid technique, an innovative tonal palette, and
                    extensive
                    repertoire, Cohen plays with the command of a seasoned veteran and the passion of an artist fully
                    devoted to his
                    medium. </p>
                <p class="colored-text">Emmet Cohen's exacting keyboard artistry has garnered numerous accolades from
                    the
                    international jazz
                    community.
                    He placed first in both the American Pianists Association Jazz Competition (2014) and the Phillips
                    Piano
                    Competition at the University of West Florida (2011). He was a finalist in the prestigious American
                    Pianists
                    Association's Cole Porter Fellowship (2015, 2011) and the Thelonious Monk International Piano
                    Competition
                    (2011). Cohen has appeared in world-renowned jazz events, including the Newport, Monterey, North
                    Sea,
                    Bern,
                    Edinburgh, Detroit, and Jerusalem jazz festivals, as well as the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage
