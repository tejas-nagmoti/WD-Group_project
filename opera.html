            </a>
            <p><strong>About 10 Days in a Madhouse:</strong> <br>Is she insane? Or just pretending? This psychological drama follows trailblazing reporter Nellie Bly through her internment at Blackwell's Asylum, exposing, as Bly did, notions of madness and societal biases against women. This world premiere from composer Rene Orth and librettist Hannah Moscovitch stars Kiera Duffy (Breaking the Waves) as Nellie, mezzo Raehann Bryce-Davis in her company debut as Lizzie, and baritone Will Liverman as Dr. Blackwell. Daniela Candillari makes her company debut at the podium, and Joanna Settle (Sky on Swings) directs. Designer Andrew Lieberman's set evokes the dark labyrinth of the asylum and Nellie's journey within its walls.</p>

Baritone Quinn Kelsey stars as Simon Boccanegra, a leader coming into great power who must balance duty to his nation with his duties as a father after his long-lost daughter Amelia (soprano Ana María Martínez) reenters his life. Surrounded by poisonous rivals, can he be the man those who love him need him to be and survive the plots of those who hate him?</p>

            <p><strong>About Unholy Wars:</strong> <br>Unholy Wars closes the dusty history book and reframes the Crusades from a Middle Eastern perspective to reveal a new story of belonging and resilience. Conceived and created by Lebanese American tenor Karim Sulayman, music by Handel and Monteverdi is interwoven with that of composer Mary Kouyoumdjian to explore and reclaim representations of his identity. Reexamining Baroque interpretations of the Crusades and depictions of the Middle East, Sulayman asks "Can we lean into the discomfort of our collective history while forging a new path forward?" This boundary-breaking piece premiered at Spoleto Festival USA, where critics called it "emotional" and "powerful." The intimate staging directed by Kevin Newbury, with visual narrative by Kevork Mourad, explores the tensions of history, representation, identity, and survival through music and dance.</p>

Karen Chia-ling Ho and Anthony Ciaramitaro bring the achingly beautiful score to life as the young geisha Cio-Cio-San and U.S. Navy Lt. Pinkerton. Anthony Clark Evans, who impressed in the title role of Rigoletto, returns as Sharpless, with mezzo Kristen Choi (The Raven) as Suzuki and tenor Julius Ahn as Goro.</p>

            <p><strong>The Cunning Little Vixen:</strong><br> The Curtis Opera Theatre’s 2023–24 season concludes with Janáček’s masterpiece, The Cunning Little Vixen, one of the most powerful operatic works of the 20th century. Led by a plucky heroine, this poetic parable celebrates the cyclical nature of life and death as it spins a comical yet bittersweet tale of Vixen Sharp Ears. Captured by a Forester, the mischievous young fox cub grows up to become a strong, independent vixen, escaping into the wild, where she encounters a forest full of possibilities. Janáček’s adaptation of the beloved Czech novella features a lushly orchestrated, folk-infused score bursting with boundless energy and an imaginative array of dazzling colors. The Cunning Little Vixen is sung in Czech with English supertitles.</p>
