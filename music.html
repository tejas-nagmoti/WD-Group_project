                    <p>Yannick and Your Philadelphia Orchestra begin the Orchestra’s 124th season with a spectacular
                        celebration! Presidential Medal of Freedom winner Yo-Yo Ma performs a work that has special
                        meaning
                        for him—Shostakovich’s Cello Concerto No. 1, written for the great Russian cellist Mstislav
                        Rostropovich. Ma first heard the work as a 15-year-old, already making his mark on the music
                        world,
                        and it moved him profoundly: “I couldn’t sleep that night.” Fiendishly challenging for the
                        player
                        and deeply rewarding for the audience, this cello masterwork shows Ma at the peak of his
                        artistry.
                    </p>
                    <p>Rachmaninoff composed his deeply spiritual Symphonic Dances in 1940, the twilight of his career.
                        His
                        final composition quotes the “Dies irae” from the Requiem Mass in the midst of the dances. The
                        lovely, lyrical alto saxophone in the first dance; the haunting violin solo and eerie waltz in
                        the
                        second; and the ethereal, delicate sounds of the glockenspiel, harp, and piano in the third
                        build to
                        a spectacular finale, evoking a battle between good and evil, spiritual and profane, ending in a
                        bold and racing burst of triumph. A brilliant coda to a life of astonishing gifts.</p>
                    <p>Jennifer Higdon’s Fanfare Ritmico bursts with energy. The three-time GRAMMY Award–winning
                        composer
                        wrote this piece on the cusp of the new millennium, noting that it “celebrates that rhythmic
                        motion
                        of man and machine, and the energy which permeates every moment of our being in the new
                        century.”

                    <p>Yannick and Hélène Grimaud have performed together all over the world, and the passion of their
                        inspired partnership shines in this performance of the Mozart Piano Concerto No. 20, a showcase
                        for
                        Grimaud’s acclaimed artistry. A recent review of her performance of this work praised her
                        “impeccable technique and concentration … her phenomenally strong, yet nimble fingers moved with
                        an
                        assertive energy” (Bachtrack).</p>
                    <p>This concert continues Yannick and the Orchestra’s exploration of the music of Florence Price,
                        whose
                        music was lost to generations and has only recently come to be considered some of the greatest
                        of
                        20th-century American music. Although she composed more than 400 works, most of it was never
                        publicly performed; in a letter to famed conductor Serge Koussevitsky, Price wrote, “I have two
                        handicaps—those of sex and race.” Price’s Fourth Symphony, written in 1945, was presumed lost
                        until
                        discovered among a nest of her papers in an abandoned house that had once been her summer home.
                        In
                        this, her final symphony, Price incorporates melodies from spirituals, including a beautifully
                        orchestrated theme from “Wade in the Water,” and the third movement embraces a traditional Juba
                        dance—a syncopated stamping, clapping movement to a rhythm that was a precursor to ragtime.</p>

                    <div><b>Brahms</b>A German Requiem</div>
                    <p>From Mozart to Berlioz to Britten, great composers have poured their souls into settings of the
                        requiem mass. Unique among them is Brahms’s utterly beautiful A German Requiem, written after
                        the
                        death of his mother, with its emphasis not on the dead, but on those left behind; not on loss,
                        but
                        on the joy of remembrance. From its opening phrase, “Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall
                        be
                        comforted,” to its transporting finale of triumph and tranquility, it touches the hearts of all
                        who
                        hear it.</p>
                    <p>Written with the intention of being paired with Brahms’s Requiem, Cuban-Canadian composer Luis
                        Ernesto Peña Laguna’s choral work Oraison was created in reaction to the COVID pandemic. Sung in
                        four languages—French, Spanish, Latin, and English—it ends on a note of joyful hope as the
                        chorus
                        sings in French, “We emerge/Barefoot on the rosy meadows/At the first morning sun.”</p>
                    <p>Another cause for joy: There’s an extraordinary, palpable energy in the hall when musicians who
                        have
                        special regard for each other come together in performance. And that’s what you can expect when
                        Yannick welcomes the preeminent violinist Gil Shaham back for the world premiere of Mason
                        Bates’s
                        Violin Concerto, a piece co-commissioned by the Orchestra. Bates’s “stunning, staggering,
                        stupendous” (Classical Voice North America) Piano Concerto thrilled Philadelphia Orchestra
                        audiences
                        in 2022; now you can hear this heralded composer’s newest work with a violinist beloved by
                        audiences

                        Williams is one of the most prolific and beloved film composers of all time, with unforgettable
                        scores including Jaws; Close Encounters of the Third Kind; the Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and
                        Harry
                        Potter films; Schindler’s List, and dozens more. But his talents go far beyond the movies.</p>
                    <p>In this one-night-only performance, Williams conducts a moving, memory-stirring selection of
                        music
                        from his films, and welcomes his long-time friend and 19-time GRAMMY winner Yo-Yo Ma for a
                        performance of his Cello Concerto.</p>
                    <p>The Concerto transports the listener, from its opening theme “as effective an introduction to a
                        character as the first five minutes of any Spielberg film” (The Washington Post) to its lyrical,
                        poignant finale. It’s a rare opportunity to hear two towering artists who have shaped much of
                        the
                        musical world of the past half-century, on stage together in a joyful reunion!</p>

                    <div><b>Emanuel Ax</b> Piano</div>

                    <div><b>Orff </b>Carmina burana</div>
                    <p>When composer Carl Orff stumbled across a collection of medieval poems and songs in the
                        mid-1930s, it
                        was a treasure trove. Tucked away in a Benedictine abbey near Munich, the original manuscript
                        contained hundreds of secular poems and songs written by university students preparing for the
                        priesthood. Despite their holy career goals, these students wrote about earthly, even bawdy
                        themes
                        of wine, women, and song, and dreamed of a pagan goddess called Fortuna, who controlled humans’
                        fate
                        with the spin of a wheel. Orff, taken with the imagery of the writing, worked with a Latin
                        scholar
                        to choose 24 of the songs and assembled them into his “scenic cantata” Carmina burana. The
                        result,
                        an hour-long work of choral and orchestral genius, seizes the listener’s sonic imagination with
                        its
                        roaring choruses, pulse-raising rhythms, monastic chants, and sighing lyricism, filled with
                        images
                        of youth bursting with love and longing. This music has thrilled audiences inside the concert
                        hall
                        and beyond, popping up frequently in film and television scores and commercials, perhaps one of
                        the
                        best-known and best-loved works in the repertoire.</p>
                    <p>This program of classics begins with one of The Philadelphia Orchestra’s most welcome guests,
                        pianist
                        Emanuel Ax, performing Mozart’s grandest piano concerto, No. 25. Ax’s popularity is based on his
                        innate musicality and a rigorous technique informed by a deep love of the music. The Washington
                        Post
                        calls him “an extremely satisfying pianist; he is at home in a wide variety of music and his
                        pianism
                        is always thoughtful, lyrical, lustrous.” Ax counts Mozart among his favorite composers, noting
                        that
                        “Mozart was an opera guy, a theater person, and the concertos are absolutely a part of that. I
                        think
                        there’s a grandeur about this piece [Piano Concerto No. 25] that is so wonderful, so big … the
                        slow
                        movement is pure magic.”</p>
                    <p>GRAMMY® Award–winning Italian conductor Fabio Luisi, renowned for his passion at the podium, has
                        won
                        rave reviews for his “exhilarating, thrilling, dynamic” performances (San Francisco Classical
                        Voice). Fun fact: When not busy conducting, Luisi is a passionate perfume maker.</p>

                        kick off the 2023–24 season with a tribute to Richard Strauss. A celebration of the German
                        Romantic
                        composer’s life and legacy, the program features highlights from some of his most popular operas
                        and
                        scales the spectacular heights of his final tone poem, An Alpine Symphony. This breathtaking
                        work
                        depicts a perilous mountain-climbing expedition from the composer’s childhood, capturing the
                        brilliance of a blazing sunrise over the Alps, the wonder of cascading waterfalls, the pastoral
                        sounds of bleating sheep, and the terrifying violence of a raging thunderstorm.</p>
                    <p>Under the baton of second-year student Micah Gleason, Curtis’s Rita E. Hauser Conducting Fellow,
                        the
                        evening opens with a dramatic instrumental interpretation of the composer’s “Dance of the Seven
                        Veils” from his harrowing psychodrama Salome. Based on the scandalous play by Oscar Wilde, this
                        one-act masterpiece recounts the Biblical story of a princess who becomes infatuated with the
                        prophet, Jokanaan (John the Baptist). Beneath the iconic scene’s lush chromaticism is a
                        discordant
                        waltz that builds to a feverish frenzy as Salome removes each of her veils in sensuous dance and
                        spirals deeper into madness.</p>
                    <p>This striking early 20th-century classic is followed by three riveting performances from two of
                        Strauss’s most popular operatic works. His satirical 1912 opera within an opera, Ariadne auf
                        Naxos,
                        is a theatrical battle between lighthearted comedy and dramatic tragedy. In the quintet “Die
                        Dame
                        gibt mit trübem Sinn,” the commedia dell’arte troupe of Brighella, Truffaldino, Scaramuccio,
                        Harlequin, and the saucy comedienne Zerbinetta, attempt to lift the spirits of the inconsolable
                        Ariadne with a charming song and dance number. This moment of comic levity is followed by the
                        Act II
                        opening of Strauss’s Der Rosenkavalier, featuring the ceremonious presentation of a silver rose
                        and
                        a rapturous love duet. The set concludes with the opera’s sublime Act III trio, as the
                        Marschallin
                        blesses the union of young lovers Octavian and Sophie.

                    address
                    the racial, political, and social issues of his time. The Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra (JLCO)
                    celebrates the
                    centennial of this pioneering legend, master musician and innovative bandleader who spanned a

                    range of
                    styles that influenced generations to follow.</p>

                    Lincoln.
                    At the time, he told DownBeat Magazine that he would “never again play anything” that did not “have

            <p class="colored-text">About the Artist</p>
            <p class="colored-text">Multifaceted American jazz pianist and composer Emmet Cohen has emerged as one
                of
                his generation's
                pivotal
                figures in music and the related arts. A recognized prodigy, Cohen began Suzuki method piano
                instruction
                at age
                three, and his playing quickly became a mature melding of musicality, technique, and concept.
                DownBeat
                observed
                that his "nimble touch, measured stride and warm harmonic vocabulary indicate he's above any
                convoluted
                technical showmanship." In the same spirit, Cohen himself has noted that playing jazz is "about
                communicating
                the deepest levels of humanity and individuality; it's essentially about connections, both among
                musicians and
                audiences." He leads his namesake ensemble, the Emmet Cohen Trio; is a vibrant solo performer, and
                is in
                constant demand as a sideman. Posessing a fluid technique, an innovative tonal palette, and
                extensive
                repertoire, Cohen plays with the command of a seasoned veteran and the passion of an artist fully
                devoted to his
                medium. </p>
            <p class="colored-text">Emmet Cohen's exacting keyboard artistry has garnered numerous accolades from
                the
                international jazz
                community.
                He placed first in both the American Pianists Association Jazz Competition (2014) and the Phillips
                Piano
                Competition at the University of West Florida (2011). He was a finalist in the prestigious American
                Pianists
                Association's Cole Porter Fellowship (2015, 2011) and the Thelonious Monk International Piano
                Competition
                (2011). Cohen has appeared in world-renowned jazz events, including the Newport, Monterey, North
                Sea,
                Bern,
                Edinburgh, Detroit, and Jerusalem jazz festivals, as well as the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage
                Festival.

            <p class="colored-text">This extraordinary performance features musicians and operatic vocalists
                focusing on
                music from Terence
                Blanchard's groundbreaking opera Fire Shut Up in My Bones, based on the memoir of celebrated writer
                and
                The New
                York Times columnist Charles Blow. With a libretto written by NAACP Image Award-winning actress,
                director, and
                screenwriter Kasi Lemmons, Fire Shut Up in My Bones premiered at Opera Theatre of Saint Louis in
                2019
                and opened
                the 2021-22 season at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in September 2021. The New York Times
                labeled
                Blanchard's opera "inspiring," "subtly powerful" and "a bold affecting adaptation of Charles Blow's
                work."

                trumpeter/composer Terence Blanchard
                has

                in
                American
                culture – past and present. Blanchard is celebrated not only for his albums and live performances
                but
                also for
                creating strong backdrops to human stories, from his expansive scores for Spike Lee films— such as
                his
                Oscar-nominated BlacKkKlansman (2018) score - to his opera, Fire Shut Up in My Bones, which marked
                the
                first

                Alpert and Lani Hall,
                Grammy-winning vocalist and former lead singer of Brazil 66 with Sergio Mendes, are world-renowned

                their
                classic recordings, "Mas Que Nada," "Fool On The Hill," "Going Out Of My Head," and "Daytripper."

                Lonely
                Bull" in 1962. Herb,
                Lani, and
                their incredible band perform an eclectic mix of American standards, Brazilian jazz, some Beatles,
                some
                classic
                Tijuana Brass, and Brazil ’66 songs as well as many surprises. The last two years may have kept Herb

                creatively and
                performance-wise. On September 30, 2022, Herb released his latest album, the 11-track Sunny Side of
                the
