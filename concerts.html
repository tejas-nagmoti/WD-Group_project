                Jonas Brothers have been a pop-rock phenomenon for nearly two decades, with five full-length albums that have sold over 17 million copies worldwide, and concert tours grossing over $300 million. In 2008, they also became the youngest band ever to grace the cover of Rolling Stone. After six years of exploring solo projects, the trio reunited in 2019 to release the Grammy Award-nominated, multi-platinum song “Sucker,” their first No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. <br><br>
                The accompanying album, 2019's Happiness Begins, debuted atop the Billboard 200 albums chart. A sold-out Broadway run in early 2023 set the stage for an iconic tour: a 37-date stadium and arena run dubbed THE TOUR, which finds the trio performing five albums each night at legendary venues such as Dodgers Stadium in Los Angeles, Wrigley Field in Chicago and Yankee Stadium in New York.     <br><br>

            <p><strong>About $UICIDEBOY$: </strong> <br> $uicideboy$ dig light out of the deepest corners of darkness, addiction, hopelessness, and pain. The New Orleans-bred duo of cousins—Scott Arcenaux, Jr. a.k.a. $crim and Aristos Petrou a.k.a. Ruby da Cherry—translate a fight against demons (seen and unseen) into a clever, caustic, and corrosively catchy apocalyptic vision of hip-hop pierced with punk intensity and laced with Southern flows. 
                <br><br>
            The world first met $uicideboy$ in 2014. After releasing dozens of projects and playing hundreds of sold-out shows, they’ve generated billions of streams and earned multiple RIAA certifications, including the platinum “…And To Those I Love, Thanks For Sticking Around” and gold “Carrollton,” “2nd Hand,” “Runnin’ Thru The 7th With My Woadies,” “Paris,” and “Kill Yourself (Part III).” Beyond their critical-acclaim from Billboard, XXL, Alternative Press, Pigeons and Planes, Hypebeast, Revolver, and more, they built their label G*59 Records into a bastion of independent talent and home to Night Lovell, Shakewell, Germ, Ramirez, and others. In 2022, the punk-rap duo landed in the Top 30 most-streamed artists across all genres and have climbed to the 92nd position of most-streamed artists of all-time with over 15 billion career streams.
