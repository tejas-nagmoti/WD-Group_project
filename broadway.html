                            Welcome to HADESTOWN, where a song can change your fate. Winner of eight 2019 Tony Awards®
                            including Best
                            Musical and the 2020 Grammy® Award for Best Musical Theater Album, this acclaimed new show
                            from celebrated
                            singer-songwriter Anaïs Mitchell and innovative director Rachel Chavkin (Natasha, Pierre &
                            The Great Comet
                            of 1812) is a love story for today... and always.</p>
                        <p>HADESTOWN intertwines two mythic tales — that of young dreamers Orpheus and Eurydice, and
                            that of King Hades
                            and his wife Persephone — as it invites you on a hell-raising journey to the underworld and
                            back. Mitchell’s
                            beguiling melodies and Chavkin’s poetic imagination pit industry against nature, doubt
                            against faith, and
                            fear against love. Performed by a vibrant ensemble of actors, dancers and singers, HADESTOWN
                            is a haunting
                            and hopeful theatrical experience that grabs you and never lets go.</p>
